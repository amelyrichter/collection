# collection
This project is a curated collection by my classmate Ishani, compiled on Are.na. It explores the ocean and its fascinating deep-sea creatures. Created as part of the Parsons Master's program, this project was developed in the Typography and Interaction 02 course. I was responsible for the design, concept, and coding of the project.
